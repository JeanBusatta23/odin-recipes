        <h1>Spaghetti Carbonara!</h1>
            <img src="Carbonara.jpg">

            <p>Spaghetti carbonara (<em>spaghetti alla carbonara</em> in Italian, pronounce: spa-GET-tie alla KAR-boh-NAA-rah) is a main course consisting of spaghetti (long thin strands of pasta) in a creamy sauce of eggs, bacon, cheese and black pepper.(</p>
    
            <p>The history of spaghetti carbonara is short; the dish only appeared in cookbooks for the first time in the 1950s-60s. The origin of the dish is shrouded in mystery and there are many different stories. It is thought that the dish comes from Rome, but that idea seems to be a little controversial.</p>

            <p>One of the most persistent stories claims that the carbonara gets its name from coal miners (carbonari). The grains of black pepper being a reference to the coal dust. It could also be that the dish was invented by a miner who opened the restaurant La Carbonara in Rome in 1912. (The restaurant itself denies this story, although they do have spaghetti carbonara on the menu). According to yet another version, it was American soldiers in the Second World War who brought the beloved combination ‘bacon & eggs’ from their homeland and thus inspired the spaghetti carbonara. </p>
