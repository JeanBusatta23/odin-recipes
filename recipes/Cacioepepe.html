        <h1>Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe!</h1>
            <img src="Cacioepepe.jpg">

            <p>Cacio e pepe is one of Italian cuisine’s oldest dishes. Food historians point to Roman shepherds as the creators of the pasta dish.(</p>
    
            <p>Sheep all of spring and summer months grazing in the open pastures and countryside. The shepherd remained alongside the sheep for the entire time. With that many months away from home, shepherds had to find practical ways to eat.</p>

            <p>The 4 ingredients of cacio e pepe were incredibly easy to carry and impossible to spoil – as the cheese was made fresh from the sheep’s milk, pepper was light to carry, and pasta could be made fresh from flour and water.</p>

            <p>On top of the ease of ingredients, there were nutritional benefits to the dish. The pasta’s carbs added on the calories and energy for the shepherd, and the spice of the pepper kept their bodies warm during cool nights.</p>
        
            <p>From the pastures and countryside, the dish traveled to local taverns and much later all across the country by the 18th century.</p>
